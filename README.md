## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming Language
- [Next.js](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - Python Web Framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

This was my first project using Python and Flask for web development, which gave me a lot of learning about this framework. I was able to assimilate most of Flask's basic concepts, especially how to create, use and implement various functionalities using macros.

### Continued development

As much as I've been able to use macros without too many problems, I believe I still have a lot to get used to with them, so I intend to focus more on macros and also on importing images, which I had a lot of difficulty with during the creation of the project, but which I later managed to overcome.
